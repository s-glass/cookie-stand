## Reflections and Comments

This series of labs was a challenge, and I fully acknowledge that my end result looks pretty awful - but at least I have all the required information, my sales table works (knock on wood it stays that way), and I did my best! I have a lot of work to do in getting my CSS more functional and less terrible, overall.
